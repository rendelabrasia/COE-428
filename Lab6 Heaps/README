Summarize the lab: 
  - I had issues with the code for getting the ascending and descending order to work. 
  - It is giving an output of the same number such as all 3s. 
  - The XML expression part of the heap works perfectly fine.
   - For the output to show up, please press ctrl + D twice.
                  
Got my inspiration with this source: https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-data-structure 
This helped me understand how the parent and children node works and how heap data structure function.

Notes taken on this Lab:
- During the coding process, I had many difficulties I faced and could not solved. I have tried many different techniques but this lab is quite difficult for me.
- I was only able to compile 3 out of 6 commands needed in the lab. I couldn't get the change command to work and I didn't know how to implement the garbage command
   and the delete command.
- Even though the change command compiles when I run it, It doesn't work properly and it doesn't give the right output when I put in the inputs. 
- No command, One/Zero command, and the Print command works perfectly fine when I put in the output. It does what it is intended to do so.
